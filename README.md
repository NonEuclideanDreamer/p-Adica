Java Project about p-Adic Numbers

The class Padic.java describes p-Adic numbers and has methods for basic operations and the metric.

There are three classes with main methods:

In PadicImage.java I axplore geometric objects in the p-Adic metric.

In PadicCA.java I tried to create a cellular Automaton on the p-Adics

In PAdicGravity.java I created a p-Adic Universe with its own force of gravity.

If you have a play with it and have questions feel free to ask, for example on my discord: https://discord.gg/SXCZWABCZC
